I am very pleased to working with you and your little friend
I have a little pig that wants to become an astronaut
The weather in London is quite lovely during the summer but i like it more in the winter
Seeing you, I feel that my life is ready to take a wonderful turn
The little white rock causes me to see things in a different light
Whatever happens you will regret that you never contacted me in person
The old and bad duck means that you will find it very easy to deliver me in the sun
On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains
